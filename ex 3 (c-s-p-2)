// The easy game of the dragon and the prince
// The prince can save the princess if he can cut off all the dragon's heads
// The prince can cut off the dragon's head with his sword
// The dragon can recover his head with his magic
// The prince can swing his sword 2 times
// If the prince can't save the princess, he will die
